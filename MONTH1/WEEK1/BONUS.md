Was getting tired of not fully understanding how pixels work so i've decided to start a series on Youtube to have a better knowledge on Image Processing. It's a 50 video playlist with an average watch time of 6 min per video. 

My goal is to go through all of this in two weeks so I'll watch two videos before and after work for a total of 4 vidoes a day. 

I'll take notes for each video and review the previous days notes at the start of each day. 

Let's get started then shall we

## Chapter 1 - What is an image?What is image processing?

Image = binary representation of some visual information. 

Image processing = input given to a system that uses an algorithm to understand the content which will lead to an output 

## Chapter 2 - What is a Pixel ?

pixel = component of an image

image = array of pixels

Binary image = composed of only O (black) and 1 (white). Each pixel need only one bit of storage space (since it's either 1 or 0). Less storage needed but hard to understand image

Black and white image !=  to binary image, since each pixel need 8 bit storage space. More storage need but better understanding of image

Grayscale =  used format is 8 bit and accomodates 256 shades in it ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white)

Color Image = each pixel represents a color. 
each pixel is composed of three channels : rgb
each channel need 8 bit storage
each channel need 24 bit storage
